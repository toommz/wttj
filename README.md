Technical test for WTTJ.

## Data

In `db/continents` we can find `GeoJSON` data representing (approximately for performance sakes) the shapes of our continents. [Raw source from this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13905646/get-the-continent-given-the-latitude-and-longitude)

## Exercice 1

**What could have been done better**

- The `WTTJ.CLI` could have been more readable if I had more time left for this first exercise.
- Some parts are not so much idiomatic `elixir` I think
- and surely other things that I didn't notice
